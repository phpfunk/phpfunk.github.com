## About this document
First and foremost, I never knew these documents existed and I am completely fascinated by this. I love this idea of me taking time to really put pen to paper to understand more about me and how we can work together. Quite brilliant.

Below you will find information about me on a personal level as well as a professional level. Truth be told, they are the same. I really aim to be my authentic self whether at work or at home. My level of comfort in each situation tends to let certain attributes shine or stay on reserve.

-- Quick notes

## About me (personal)
1. Where I'm From
2. Activities and hobbies
3. Personality type
4. My Why Statement

## Core Principles & Values
- Transparency
- Embrace our differences
- Trust first
- Lead with your second thought
- Metrics and Measurement

- Work in iterations, I never want to think about perfect
- Make mistakes

## What It's Like Working With Me (need a better title)
- People & Team first, always
- 1:1s - build trust and understanding. Key component for both parties to grow. — trello is sort of amazing for 1:1s and tracking.
- I serve the team
- Why is the most important metric to track
- Things I love
- Things I tend to shy away from
- I want to empower you to solve your own problems

## Quirks
- I can be shy at first, the best way for me to get going is just ask me questions
- I like to ask a lot of questions. I believe questions are the key to success. Often times we rush into things w/o understanding why.
- I do not like to raise my voice. I will likely never be the loudest person in the room. I see no value in that. Loud <> correct, loud just == loud.
- I will always set a slack availability, it’s odd but in my head, I have to
- I sometimes move my lips but don’t speak when I think…Apologies in advance if we are on zoom and you ask if I said something :D

## Feedback
- I really don't like public praise, I tend to shy away from it.
- I want feedback whether it's good or bad in both directions. (from the team and leadership)
- I would love to understand how you like to feedback to not make you feel uncomfortable
- I will NEVER give personal criticism in public
- Encourage you to feel comfortable giving feedback to your peers
