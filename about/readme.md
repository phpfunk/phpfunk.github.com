## About this document
First and foremost, I never knew these documents existed and I am completely fascinated by this. I love this idea of me taking time to really put pen to paper to understand more about me and how we can work together. I think it will also allow me to understand myself better. Quite brilliant.

Below you will find information about me on a personal level as well as a professional level. Truth be told, they are the same. I really aim to be my authentic self no matter the situation. My level of comfort in each situation tends to let certain attributes shine or stay on reserve.

## About Me
My name is Jeff Johns and I live in [Bethlehem, PA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bethlehem,+PA/@40.6253013,-75.4010458,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c43e4acc94c115:0x4ec59c491c91b283!8m2!3d40.6259316!4d-75.3704579) along with my wife Annie, 3 children (Anya, Ivy, and Olen), and our dog Herman. As a family we spend most of our time traveling to soccer related events. Soccer (football) is a household favorite, when not traveling for soccer events I have a few personal hobbies.

- [collecting vinyl records](https://www.discogs.com/user/phpfunk/collection)
- Tinkering with cars
- [coding personal projects](https://github.com/phpfunk)
- I used to love running, but this [race](https://calendar.ultrarunning.com/runner/show?first_name=Jeff&last_name=Johns&runner_id=9291) broke me.

### Personality Types
Over the years I've been asked to take a few personality tests at work. I personally find them fascinating and most of the time spot on. Some results that may interest you:

- Myers Briggs: [INFJ](https://www.verywellmind.com/infj-introverted-intuitive-feeling-judging-2795978)
- Ennegram: [Type 5](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-5-investigator)
- Spirit Animal: [Bear](https://trustedpsychicmediums.com/spirit-animals/bear-spirit-animal/) - Yes, I really took a test for this &#128513;

What I've been able to take away and fully believe in:
- I lead with empathy & trust
- I like to digest information before I respond
- If I don't share early and often, I may not share at all
- Sometimes I stretch myself too thin because I want to be helpful
- I adore planning and organization &#129505;

### My Why Statement
*'Creating meaningful relationships to encourage growth'* is how I try to live my life whether at work or at home. I focus a lot of my time and energy on relationships so we can build trust and continue to grow. I genuinely care about people and their well being. I want to see everyone around me succeed, this brings me energy and fulfillment.

## Core Principles
Over the years I've gone through iterations of how I work and what I believe in. I believe it's important to try and stay as closely aligned to your principles as possible. If you want to be your authentic self, then you need to know where you stand.

### Be as Transparent as Possible
Not everyone feels comfortable discussing every topic in a fully transparent fashion. I want people to be as transparent as possible. If you feel comfortable discussing a topic, let's go. If not, say that. Don't hide from it, let me know you don't feel comfortable and we will find another path.

### Embrace our Differences
We are all different for a reason. We all think differently, feel differently, see things differently. This is a blessing. Embrace the differences we see and discuss them to make a more successful tomorrow. Ask questions, everyone's thoughts and opinions matter. We are only as good as our entire team.

### Trust First
I lead with trust from day one. We're all here for a reason and you don't need to earn trust. We may lose each other's trust at times and have to earn it back, but from day one, trust is given.

### Lead with Your Second Thought
If you've worked with me for some time, you may hear me say this. We all have our first reactionary thought. Don't say that, it's typically filled with emotion that may cause people to not hear what you really want to say. Wait for your second thought, if you don't have one, sit on that first thought to make sure it's the right thing to say. Sometimes saying nothing is the right thing to say.

### Iterations are the New Perfect
I do not believe in perfect. I believe in small iterations to succeed. Whether that is a feature, personal growth, an operational change. Keep it small, keep iterating, and revert if you need to.

### Make Mistakes
Mistakes are key for growth. You always learn more about yourself and your work when you make a mistake. Make them, but learn from them. I never be upset about mistakes, unless we are continually repeating the same mistakes without learning from them.

## Me as a Manager / Leader
The above principles can say a lot about how I tend to work, but can also leave things up to interpretation. I want to be as clear as possible as to my expectations and the way I work as a manager & leader.

### People & Team First, Always
While we all have our own personal growth goals, we need to think about the team. Our own growth can only go so far if you aren't thinking about the team. When the team is successful, we're all successful.

### 1:1s
One on ones happen either weekly or biweekly. Your choice. They can range from 30, 45, or 60 minutes. Again, your choice. I tend to like to set up trello boards to track topics and not lose sight of our goals. This is a not an update session on tasks or projects, this is about you and your growth. The trello board will be populated by both myself and you with relevant topics.

### Feedback Loops
- I really don't like public praise, I tend to shy away from it. It's okay to embarrass me with this, but I will turn red and not say much.
- I want & expect feedback whether it's good or bad in both directions. From the team and leadership.
- I would love to understand how you like to feedback to not make you feel uncomfortable.
- I will **NEVER** give criticism in public.
- I will **ALWAYS** encourage you to give feedback to your peers.

### Communication Style
I think of communication in 3 aspects:
- I need an immediate answer: Call me
- I need an answer sometime today: Slack Me
- I need an answer sometime this week: Email Me

### Always Ask Why
Why is the most important metric to track. If you don't know why you are building something, stop. If you don't know why you are being asked to do a task, please stop. We should all be asking 'Why' when we don't know. It is the most important metric we can track.

### Empower You to Solve Your Own Problems
The last thing I want is for me to just solve problems for you. It doesn't benefit you or me. I want to help you find the ways to solve your own problems. When you come to me with a problem I am likely going to ask you 'Well, what do you think?'. This isn't because I don't have an opinion, it's because I want to hear yours. I want you to make mistakes and find the right path for you. We will solve problems together.

### Work/Life Balance
I value time away from work to relax and recharge. You should as well. I don't normally check email/slack in off times. If you do need me during non-core hours, please give me a call. I will always answer or get right back to you.

## Things I Need Help With
We all have things we need help improving. Below are a few things I could always use feedback and help with to improve.

- I default to problem solving in conversations. If it's not something you want me to solve, but rather be your rubber duck, please tell me up front.
- At times I can hold a decision too long because I want data. I know in my gut the right thing to do. Please push me outside my comfort zone if you see this. I will respond.
- When there are loud people in the room, I can tend to back down. In those situations, I think it is helpful to call on people not talking to give everyone a chance to voice opinions.
- If I look lost it is likely because I've been thinking about a problem for too long, please tell me to take a walk. Everything is solved on walks.

## Personality Quirks
- I can be shy at first, ask me questions, I will open up right away.
- In stressful situations I tend to bring comedy to break tension. Sorry in advance.
- I always set my availability in slack, while not needed, I feel like I need to.
- I like to ask a lot of questions. It's not because I don't trust you, it's because I believe asking questions and uncover things we didn't think about.
- Sometimes I throw out "dumb" ideas just to get people talking.
- I do not like to raise my voice. I will likely never be the loudest person in the room.
- I sometimes move my lips but don’t speak when I think…Apologies in advance if we are on zoom and you ask if I said something &#128513;
