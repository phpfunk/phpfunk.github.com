# Intro
First and foremost, I never knew these documents existed and I am completely fascinated by this. I love the idea of me taking time to really put pen to paper to understand more about me and how we can work together. I think it will also allow me to understand myself better. Quite brilliant.

Below you will find information about me on a personal level as well as a professional level. Truth be told, they are the same. I really aim to be my authentic self no matter the situation. My level of comfort in each situation tends to let certain attributes shine or stay on reserve.

# About Me
My name is Jeff Johns and I live in [Bethlehem, PA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Just+Born+Quality+Confections/@40.6320851,-75.3562492,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c43fcfb5e887a1:0xfe15a5d32a833bd4!8m2!3d40.632081!4d-75.3540605) along with my wife Annie, our 3 children (Anya, Ivy, and Olen), and our dog Herman. As a family we spend most of our time traveling to soccer (football) related events. When not traveling for soccer events I have a few personal hobbies.

- [collecting vinyl records](https://www.discogs.com/user/phpfunk/collection)
- [Tinkering with cars](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZVjtpfjzqjpY5dz9)
- [coding personal projects](https://github.com/phpfunk)
- I used to love running, but this [race](https://calendar.ultrarunning.com/runner/show?first_name=Jeff&last_name=Johns&runner_id=9291) broke me.

### Personality Types
Over the years I've been asked to take a few personality tests at work. I find them fascinating and most of the time spot on. Some results that may interest you:

- Myers Briggs: [INFJ](https://www.verywellmind.com/infj-introverted-intuitive-feeling-judging-2795978)
- Ennegram: [Type 5](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-5-investigator)
- Spirit Animal: [Bear](https://trustedpsychicmediums.com/spirit-animals/bear-spirit-animal/) - Yes, I really took a test for this &#128513;

**What I've been able to take away and believe in:**
- I lead with empathy & trust
- I like to digest information before I respond
- If I don't share early and often, I may not share at all
- Sometimes I stretch myself too thin because I want to be helpful
- I adore planning and organization &#129505;

### My Why Statement
**'Creating meaningful relationships to encourage growth'** is how I try to live my life. I focus a lot of my time and energy on relationships so we can build trust and continue to grow. I genuinely care about people and their well being. I want to see everyone around me succeed, this brings me energy and fulfillment.

# My Core Principles
Over the years I've gone through iterations of how I work and what I believe in. I believe it's important to try and stay as closely aligned to your principles as possible. If you want to be your authentic self, then you need to know where you stand.

### Be as Transparent as Possible
Not everyone feels comfortable discussing every topic in a fully transparent fashion. I want people to be as transparent as possible. If you feel comfortable discussing a topic, let's go. If not, say that. Don't hide from it, let me know you don't feel comfortable and we will find another path.

### Embrace our Differences
We are all different for a reason. We all think differently, feel differently, see things differently. This is a blessing. Embrace the differences we see and discuss them to make a more successful tomorrow. Ask questions, everyone's thoughts and opinions matter. We are only as good as our entire team.

### Trust First
I lead with trust from day one. We're all here for a reason and you don't need to earn trust. We may lose each other's trust at times and have to earn it back, but from day one, trust is given.

### Lead with Your Second Thought
If you've worked with me for some time, you may hear me say this. We all have our first reactionary thought. Don't say that, it's typically filled with emotion that may cause people to not hear what you really want to say. Wait for your second thought, if you don't have one, it's okay to say nothing. Sometimes saying nothing is enough.

# Me as a Manager / Leader
The above principles can say a lot about how I tend to work, but can also leave things up to interpretation. I want to be as clear as possible as to my expectations and the way I work as a manager & leader.

### People & Team First, Always
My primary goals are to make the team and each individual as successful as possible. The two are not exclusive. Individuals can only grow so much without the team and team cannot grow without each individual's growth. Collaboration is key for a successful team and the growth of each engineer. I expect we all put egos and titles aside and solve problems together. I will work with each team member on their growth plans and what a future could look like for them to not only help them, but the entire team.

### 1:1s
One on ones happen either weekly or biweekly. Your choice. They can range from 30, 45, or 60 minutes. Again, your choice. I tend to like to set up trello boards to track topics and not lose sight of our goals. This is a not an update session on tasks or projects, this is about you and your growth. The trello board will be populated by both you and myself with relevant topics.

### Feedback Loops
- I want & expect feedback whether it's good or bad in both directions. From the team and leadership.
- I will give feedback to my team, peers, and leadership when need be.
- I want to understand how you like to receive feedback to make you comfortable.
- I will **NEVER** give criticism in public.
- I will **ALWAYS** encourage you to give feedback to your peers.

### Communication Channels
- You need an immediate answer: Call Me
- You need an answer sometime today: Slack Me
- You need an answer sometime this week: Email Me

### Always Ask Why
Why is the most important metric to track. If you don't know why you are building something, stop. If you don't know why you are being asked to do a task, please stop. We should all be asking 'Why' when we don't know.

### Ownership
I expect that if you take the work, you own the work. If you are having issues, let's talk, I will help. I do not micromanage. I expect you to deliver what you say you will in the timeframe you agreed to.

### Problem Solving
We will solve problems together. I will not solve your problems for you. It doesn't benefit you or me. When you come to me with a problem I am likely going to ask you 'Well, what do you think?'. This isn't because I don't have an opinion, it's because I want to hear yours. I want you to make mistakes and find the right path. I will help you find the tools & skillsets you need to solve problems.

### Conflict Resolution
Let's be honest, conflicts happen. Even with best intentions, they happen. When conflicts between people arise I will not solve this for you. Again, I will help you solve the problem and give you the right tools to feel ready to have the right conversation, but I will not speak for you. I have and I will be a 3rd party in conflict resolution when needed.

### Iterations are the New Perfect
I don't believe in perfect. I believe in small iterations to succeed. Whether that is a feature, personal growth, or an operational change. Keep it small, keep iterating, and revert if you need to. Need proof? Just check out the [commit history](https://github.com/phpfunk/phpfunk.github.com/commits/aboutme/about/readme.md) for this readme.

### Make Mistakes
Mistakes are key for growth. I have failed at everything in this readme at some point in my life. You always learn more about yourself and your work when you make a mistake. I never get upset about mistakes, unless we are continually repeating the same mistakes without learning from them.

### Work/Life Balance
I value time away from work to relax and recharge. You should as well. I don't normally check email/slack in off times. If you do need me during non-core hours, please give me a call. I will always answer or get right back to you. I will not contact you in off times unless it is an emergency. They make delayed sending in slack and gmail for this very reason.

# Things I Need Help With
We all have things we need help improving. Below are a few things I could always use help with to improve.

- I default to problem solving in conversations. If that's not your need, but rather me being your rubber duck, please tell me up front.
- At times I can hold a decision too long because I want data to be sure. Please push me outside my comfort zone if you see this. I will respond.
- When there are loud people in the room, I can tend to back down. In those situations, I think it's helpful to call on people to give everyone a chance to voice opinions.
- If I look lost it is likely because I've been thinking about a problem for too long, please tell me to take a walk. Everything is solved on walks.

# Personality Quirks
- I can be shy at first, ask me questions, I will open up.
- I really don't like public praise. It's okay to embarrass me with this, I will recover.
- In stressful situations I tend to bring comedy to break tension. Sorry in advance.
- I always set my availability in slack, you can tell me it's not required but I'll still do it.
- I like to ask a lot of questions. It's not because I don't trust you, it's because I believe asking questions might uncover things we didn't think about.
- Sometimes I throw out "dumb" ideas just to get people talking.
- I do not like to raise my voice and feel embarrassed if I do.
- I sometimes move my lips but don’t speak when I think…Apologies in advance if we are on zoom and you ask if I said something &#128513;
