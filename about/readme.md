# Intro
Creating this document was a great experience. It is intended to be an "About Me" for not only what I'm like as manager and leader, but also what I'm like as a person. It allows you to get to know me and allows me to really think about how I lead. Quite brilliant.

Below you will find information about me on a personal and professional level. Truth be told, they are the same. I really aim to be my authentic self no matter the situation. My level of comfort in each situation tends to let certain attributes shine or stay on reserve.

# About Me
My name is Jeff Johns and I live in [Bethlehem, PA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Just+Born+Quality+Confections/@40.6320851,-75.3562492,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c43fcfb5e887a1:0xfe15a5d32a833bd4!8m2!3d40.632081!4d-75.3540605) along with my wife Annie, our 3 children (Anya, Ivy, and Olen), and our dog Herman. As a family we spend most of our time traveling to soccer (football) related events. When not traveling for soccer events I have a few personal hobbies.

- [Tinkering with cars](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZVjtpfjzqjpY5dz9)
- [coding personal projects](https://github.com/phpfunk)
- I used to love running, but this [race](https://calendar.ultrarunning.com/runner/show?first_name=Jeff&last_name=Johns&runner_id=9291) broke me.

### Personality Types
Over the years I've been asked to take a few personality tests at work. I find them fascinating and most of the time spot on. Some results that may interest you:

- Myers Briggs: [INFJ](https://www.verywellmind.com/infj-introverted-intuitive-feeling-judging-2795978)
- Ennegram: [Type 5](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-5-investigator)
- Spirit Animal: [Bear](https://trustedpsychicmediums.com/spirit-animals/bear-spirit-animal/) - Yes, I really took a test for this &#128513;

**What I've been able to take away and believe in:**
- I lead with empathy & trust
- I like to digest information before I respond
- I work better with due dates
- Sometimes I stretch myself too thin because I want to be helpful
- I adore planning, organization, and flowcharts &#129505; -- that seems really strange to say out loud

**Mitigation Strategies For My Shortcomings**
- If I don't set a due date, set one for me. It drives me to share early.
- Push back on me if you see me taking on too much
- Let me think for a bit and follow up
- Continue to push me outside my comfort zones

### My Why Statement
**'Creating meaningful relationships to encourage growth'** is how I try to live my life. I focus a lot of my time and energy on relationships so we can build trust and continue to grow. I genuinely care about people and their well being. I want to see everyone around me succeed, this brings me energy and fulfillment.

# My Core Principles
Over the years I've gone through iterations of how I work and what I believe in. I believe it's important to try and stay as closely aligned to your principles as possible. If you want to be your authentic self, then you need to know where you stand.

### Transparency
Not everyone feels comfortable discussing every topic in a fully transparent fashion. I want people to be as transparent as possible. If you feel comfortable discussing a topic, let's go. If not, say that. Don't hide from it, let me know you don't feel comfortable and we will find another path.

### Embrace our Differences
We are all different for a reason. We all think differently, feel differently, see things differently. This is a blessing. Embrace the differences we see and discuss them to make a more successful tomorrow. Ask questions, everyone's thoughts and opinions matter. We are only as good as our entire team.

### Trust First
I lead with trust from day one. We're all here for a reason and you don't need to earn trust. We may lose each other's trust at times and have to earn it back, but from day one, trust is given.

### Lead With Your Second Thought
If you've worked with me a bit and I sense you are reacting instead of responding, you've likely heard me say this statement. What this means is we all have times where we react rather than digest the situation so we can clearly respond. If you find yourself reacting instead of thinking out your response, stop for a second, breathe, and see if a second thought comes to you. It takes some practice, but can be really helpful in stressful situations. It's ok to not respond right away and say let me get back to you later. Take some time to think out a proper response.

# Me as a Leader
The above principles can say a lot about how I tend to work, but can also leave things up to interpretation. I want to be as clear as possible as to my expectations and the way I work as a manager & leader.

### People & Team First
My primary goals are to make the team and each individual as successful as possible. The two are not exclusive. Individuals can only grow so much without the team and team cannot grow without each individual's growth. Collaboration is key for a successful team and the growth of each engineer. I expect we all put egos and titles aside and solve problems together. I will work with each team member on their growth plans and what a future could look like for them to not only help them, but the entire team.

I believe if people/team know you have their backs in tough times, have their best interests in mind, and you are focusing your time on their growth, they can focus on delivering to meet company goals. To me it's not team over company or vice-versa, they work together. I don't believe there should be a tradeoff between company, team, or personal goals. They should work in harmony. If not, ask why to understand better.

Fulfilled people make great teams that build successful products.

### 1:1s
One on ones happen either weekly or biweekly. Your choice. They can range from 30, 45, or 60 minutes. Again, your choice. I tend to like to set up trello boards to track topics and not lose sight of our goals. This is a not an update session on tasks or projects, this is about you and your growth. The trello board will be populated by both you and myself with relevant topics. If we are having open and honest 1:1s, there should be no question of where you stand in your growth.

### My Calendar
I like to book my calendar with not only meetings but blocks of time to get things done. I am open to you booking your own time on my calendar but please be respectful of time blocks that are already booked. If you book a meeting on my calendar I expect the invite to have an agenda and what you would like the outcome to be. If not, I will reach out to you before I accept your invite.

### Hiring Philosophy
I always strive to hire the best person for the job. It is more important for the hire to align well with the company's values rather than just skills alone. Skills can always be taught but if the person's values don't align with the company's, things won't work out and it usually ends up hurting the team more than helping them.

### Feedback
- I want & expect feedback whether it's good or bad in both directions. From the team and leadership.
- I will give honest feedback to my team, peers, and leadership.
- I want to understand how you like to receive feedback to make you comfortable.
- I will **NEVER** give criticism in public.
- I will **ALWAYS** encourage you to give feedback to your peers.

### Communication Channels
- You have an emergency: Call Me
- You need an answer sometime today: Slack Me
- You need an answer sometime this week: Email Me

### Always Ask Why
Why is the most important metric to track. If you don't know why you are building something, stop. If you don't know why you are being asked to do a task, please stop. We should all be asking 'Why' when we don't know.

### Ownership
I expect that if you take the work, you own the work. If you are having issues, let's talk, I will help. I do not micromanage. I expect you to deliver what you say you will in the timeframe you agreed to.

### Problem Solving
We will solve problems together. I will not solve your problems for you. It doesn't benefit you or me. When you come to me with a problem I am likely going to ask you 'Well, what do you think?'. This isn't because I don't have an opinion, it's because I want to hear yours. I want you to make mistakes and find the right path. I will help you find the tools & skillsets you need to solve problems.

### Conflict Resolution
Let's be honest, conflicts happen. Even with best intentions, they happen. When conflicts between people arise I will not solve this for you. Again, I will help you solve the problem and give you the right tools to feel ready to have the right conversation, but I will not speak for you. I have and I will be a 3rd party in conflict resolution when needed.

### Iterations Lead to Success
I don't believe in perfect. I believe in small iterations to succeed. Whether that is a feature, personal growth, or an operational change. Keep it small, keep iterating, and revert if you need to. Need proof? Just check out the [commit history](https://github.com/phpfunk/phpfunk.github.com/commits/aboutme/about/readme.md) for this readme.

### Make Mistakes
Mistakes are key for growth. I've failed at everything in this readme at some point in my life. You always learn more about yourself and your work when you make a mistake. I never get upset about mistakes, unless we are continually repeating the same mistakes without learning from them. I even had a hat made around this.

### Work/Life Balance
I value time away from work to relax and recharge. You should as well. I don't normally check email/slack in off times. If you do need me during non-core hours, please give me a call. I will always answer or get right back to you. I will not contact you in off times unless it is an emergency. They make delayed sending in slack and gmail for this very reason.

# What Does Success Look Like
- The team is consistently delivering valuable updates to customers
- The team is hitting their goals that rollup to company goals
- The team is comfortable pushing back when they don't understand why
- The team can operate without me
- Everyone is comfortable giving me feedback
- Individuals have growth plans and are working towards the next stage of their career

# Things I Need Help With
We all have things we need help improving. Below are a few things I could always use help with to improve.

- I default to problem solving in conversations. If that's not your need, but rather me being your rubber duck, please tell me up front.
- At times I can hold a decision if I don't have the data to back me up. My gut is usually right, just push me without data at times.
- When there are loud people in the room, I can tend to be more reserved. In those situations, I think it's helpful to call on people to give everyone a chance to voice opinions.

# Personality Quirks
- I can be shy at first, ask me questions, I will open up.
- I really don't like public praise. It's okay to embarrass me with this, I will recover.
- In stressful situations I tend to bring comedy to break tension. Sorry in advance.
- I like to ask a lot of questions. It's not because I don't trust you, it's because I believe asking questions might uncover things we didn't think about.
- Sometimes I throw out "dumb" ideas just to get people talking.
- I do not like to raise my voice and feel embarrassed if I do.
- I sometimes move my lips but don’t speak when I think…Apologies in advance if we are on zoom and you ask if I said something &#128513;
